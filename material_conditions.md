# The Consequences of Poor Material Conditions

## **Nutrition**

- “Poor diet in utero and during early postnatal life can cause lasting changes in many aspects of metabolic and central functions, including [impairments in cognition and accelerated brain aging](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-017-0008-y).” It does not help that low food security, or availability in healthy nutritious food, in the US has gone up 1.7% from 2005 to 2015 and that this is considered statistically significant. [source pg. 22](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/84973/err-237.pdf?v=42979). In addition, very low food insecurity has increased significantly by 1.3% throughout the 2005-2015 period.
- "The proportion of individuals living in food deserts significantly explained 4th grade achievement scores, after accounting for additional predictors. School districts with higher proportions of individuals living in food desert regions [demonstrated lower 4th grade achievement across science, English and math](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274497/#ref1)."
- Child and adolescent obesity rates disproportionaly increase for [lower income groups and racial minorities](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/leading-health-indicators/2020-lhi-topics/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/data#NWS-9). Obesity brings [major health risks](http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/20100629fasinfatmainreport.pdf) such as Type II diabetes, heart disease and stroke, cancer, heightened risk for dementia, depression, anxiety, and kidney disorders (pg. 101).

200 - 399 | 16.9
400 - 499 | 11.9
500+ | 12.3

- [$12 billion per year](https://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/advertising-children) is spent in advertising towards children, many times employing psychological tricks to enable purchases of "candy, fast foods, and snacks." Such targeted pressure by corporate interest groups result in a flurry of social antagonisms, such as "parent–child conflicts occur[ing] commonly when parents deny their children's product purchase requests that were precipitated by advertising." This has also resulted in increase childhood obesity as "[s]everal studies have found strong associations between increases in advertising for nonnutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity."
